==========================================================================
Currently, multiple clients can connect to the server and send messages.
There are no issues with clients being disconnected, or messages not showing up on the server.
Clients can disconnect from the server by typing quit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
- Allow clients to see other user's messages from their screen (not just on the server screen).
- Add a timer for the server to close on its own if no clients are connected.
